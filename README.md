# React Fundamentals Projects

This repository contains multiple mini-projects built using **React.js**. These projects helped me strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals such as components, props, state management, hooks, and event handling.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 🚍 BusBooking
A simple bus seat booking interface.

### 🔢 Counter  
A basic counter app with increment and decrement functionality.

Allows users to book movie tickets and view details.  

### 🛒 Store

These hands-on projects helped me become **proficient in fundamental concepts of React**, including:
- JSX and component structure  
- State and props  
- Event handling  
- Conditional rendering  
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
